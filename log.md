# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 21, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Learn about React state, functional components, Controlled components. Completed mongoDB basic course week 1.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with controlled component and have to learn more about JSX, ES6 or ES7 new features.
